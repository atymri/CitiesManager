# CitiesManager

Welcome to CitiesManager! This is a C# project for keeping track of city data in a simple, extensible way. Whether you want to add new cities, update info, or explore how a clean architecture works in .NET – this repo makes it easy to get started.

## What’s Inside?

- `CitiesManager.API`: All the Web API stuff, so you can interact with city data over HTTP.
- `CitiesManager.Core`: The main logic and models that handle cities, designed to keep things decoupled and maintainable.
- `CitiesManager.Infrastructure`: Code for connecting to databases and other services.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atymri/CitiesManager.git
    ```
2. **Open in Visual Studio**
    - Just load up `CitiesManagerSolution.sln`.

3. **Restore dependencies**
